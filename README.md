# OpenSystemZrSat.m

Matlab scripts to implement the stochastic fractional crystallization (FC) and recharge fraction crystallization (FC) zircon saturation model from Tavazzani et al. (2020).

## Usage

The folder [LiteratureData/] (LiteratureData/) contains comma-separated files containing CA-ID-TIMS zircon ages datasets for a number of intrusive and volcanic magmatic systems. SSSS.m is a Matlab script dedicated to load and bootstrap all the datasets as to provide a comparison with stochastically sampled synthetic zircon distributions. New datasets of interest can be added as comma-separated files in [LiteratureData/] (LiteratureData/), to load and bootstrap the newly added zircon dates SSSS.m need to be modified (for info you can contact[ltavazzani@smu.edu])(mailto:ltavazzani@smu.edu).
